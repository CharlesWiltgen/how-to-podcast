## Contributing

If you’d like to contribute, there’s several ways to do it. Hopefully one of them works great for you.

* To the right of every paragraph is a ⊞ that allows you to leave comments. (It requires a GitBooks account, which is pretty easy to make.)

* If email is easier, you can always send feedback and change requests to me at [cwiltgen@gmail.com](mailto://cwiltgen@gmail.com).

* Finally, if the idea of GitHub doesn’s scare you 🙂 the source repository is at https://github.com/CharlesWiltgen/how-to-podcast/. Pull requests are welcome!
