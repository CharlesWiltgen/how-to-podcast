## Contributing

If youâ€™d like to contribute, thereâ€™s several ways to do it. Hopefully one of them works great for you.

* To the right of every paragraph is a âŠž that allows you to leave comments. (It requires a GitBooks account, which is pretty easy to make.)

* If email is easier, you can always send feedback and change requests to me at [cwiltgen@gmail.com](mailto://cwiltgen@gmail.com).

* Finally, if the idea of GitHub doesnâ€™s scare you ðŸ™‚ the source repository is at https://github.com/CharlesWiltgen/how-to-podcast/. Pull requests are welcome!
