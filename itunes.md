# About iTunes

## Common questions

### How long will iTunes take to approve my podcast?

This is hugely variable — 2 hours to 14 days!

**Tip:** Prepare a short “Welcome” episode and submit that. You can always delete it before your official launch.

### Which day of the week should I release my podcast?

There’s no “right” answer to this.

That said: Tuesdays.

* For decades, Tuesday was the day that new music came out.

* Mondays and Fridays, people are often distracted either preparing for their work-week or the weekend, respectively.
