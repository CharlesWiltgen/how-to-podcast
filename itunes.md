## Making iTunes links

Note that everyone should be using the "mt" parameter as well, which helps the OS to launch the right store in the right app. Best bet? Use iTunes Link Maker \([https:\/\/linkmaker.itunes.apple.com\/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinkmaker.itunes.apple.com%2F&h=EAQGEiFT3)\), and then append "&ls=1".

## Common questions

### How long will iTunes take to approve my podcast?

This is hugely variable — 2 hours to 14 days!

As a workaround, you can prepare a short “Welcome” episode and submit that. You can always delete it before your official launch.

### Which day of the week should I release my podcast?

There’s no “right” answer to this.

That said: Tuesdays.

* For decades, Tuesday was the day that new music came out.

* Mondays and Fridays, people are often distracted either preparing for their work-week or the weekend, respectively.
