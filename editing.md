Editing

## Tools

**[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)** (Mac/Win/Linux) is the most popular free choice by a long shot. The main problem with it is that it's an old-style "destructive" audio editor, and so teaches habits that users will have to overcome if/when they graduate to a modern, non-destructive audio editor.

**[Audition](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)** is great. It's main drawback is Adobe's rental-only pricing model. It's a great deal if you already need Adobe Creative Cloud for other stuff, otherwise $20/month.

Many people really like **[Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)**. The discounted license is only $60, but if I believe you may be able to "try" it for free as long as you like.

**[Presonus Studio One](http://studioone.presonus.com/)** is wonderful. There's a free Studio One Prime edition available.

**[Hindenburg Journalist](http://hindenburg.com/products/hindenburg-journalist)** is unique, in that it's an audio editor designed especially for spoken-word productions.

My 2¢ on editing: It's best to upgrade from Audacity to a modern, non-destructive editor as quickly as is practical. Audition is a wonderful choice, but the "rental" pricing kinda sucks unless you need Adobe CC anyway.

Other great editors include Hindenburg Journalist ($95), Reaper ($60), and Presonus Studio One (free edition available).

## Editing styles

Different content requires different editing styles.

### School of thought #1: “Live to tape”

Avoid editing completely when possible.  Provides a “you are there” experience, with all of the good and bad that entails.

### School of thought #2: Balanced approach

Edit out excess verbal tics and hiccups, stuttering, and pauses.  The goal is for the result to sound natural, without anything that would distract.

If you have guests, they will likely appreciate the effort made toward making them sound as smart and capable as they are.

**Time requirement:** ~2 minutes for every minute of recorded source.

### School of thought #3: NPR quality

Edit with a bias for perfection, even if it involves making edits that savvier listeners might pick up.

**Time requirement:** 3+ minutes for every minute of recorded source.

## Tips & Tricks

The easiest editing is editing you don't have to do.  Make an effort to avoid “um”s, “ah”s and “like”s — a.k.a. “fluency killers” — while recording.  They are credibility killers.
