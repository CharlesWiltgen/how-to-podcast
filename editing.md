## Tools

**[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)** is very popular, primarily because it’s free. It’s an old-style "destructive" audio editor, and so teaches habits that users will have to overcome. It's best to upgrade from Audacity to a modern, non-destructive editor as quickly as is practical. (macOS/Win/Linux)

**[Adobe Audition](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)** is great. It's main drawback is Adobe's rental-only pricing model ($20/month), which kinda sucks unless you need Adobe CC anyway. (macOS/Win)

**[Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)** is an inexpensive and well-liked (by Reaper users) choice. The discounted license is only $60, but you can "try" it for free as long as you like. (macOS/Win)

**[Presonus Studio One](http://studioone.presonus.com/)** is wonderful and not known about by enough podcasters. There's a free [Studio One Prime](https://shop.presonus.com/products/studio-one-prods/Studio-One-3-Prime) edition available. (macOS/Win)

**[Hindenburg Journalist](http://hindenburg.com/products/hindenburg-journalist)** is unique, in that it's an audio editor designed especially for spoken-word productions. (macOS/Win)

## Editing styles

Different content requires different editing styles.

### School of thought #1: “Live to tape”

Avoid editing completely when possible.  Provides a “you are there” experience, with all of the good and bad that entails.

### School of thought #2: Balanced approach

Edit out excess verbal tics and hiccups, stuttering, and pauses.  The goal is for the result to sound natural, without anything that would distract.

If you have guests, they will likely appreciate the effort made toward making them sound as smart and capable as they are.

**Time requirement:** ~2 minutes for every minute of recorded source.

### School of thought #3: NPR quality

Edit with a bias for perfection, even if it involves making edits that savvier listeners might pick up.

**Time requirement:** 3+ minutes for every minute of recorded source.

## Tips & Tricks

The easiest editing is editing you don't have to do.  Make an effort to avoid “um”s, “ah”s and “like”s — a.k.a. “fluency killers” — while recording.  They are credibility killers.
