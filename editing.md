Editing
=======

The easiest editing is editing you don't have to do.  Make an effort to avoid “um”s, “ah”s and “like”s — a.k.a. “fluency killers” — while recording.  They are credibility killers.

## Editing styles

Different content requires different editing styles.

### School of thought #1: “Live to tape”

Avoid editing completely when possible.  Provides a “you are there” experience, with all of the good and bad that entails.

### School of thought #2: Balanced approach

Edit out excess verbal tics and hiccups, stuttering, and pauses.  The goal is for the result to sound natural, without anything that would distract.

If you have guests, they will likely appreciate the effort made toward making them sound as smart and capable as they are.

**Time requirement:** ~2 minutes for every minute of recorded source.

### School of thought #3: NPR quality

Edit with a bias for perfection, even if it involves making edits that savvier listeners might pick up.

**Time requirement:** 3+ minutes for every minute of recorded source.

## Tools

### Windows

### Mac

My 2¢ on editing: It's best to upgrade from Audacity to a modern, non-destructive editor as quickly as is practical. Audition is a wonderful choice, but the "rental" pricing kinda sucks unless you need Adobe CC anyway.

Other great editors include Hindenburg Journalist ($95), Reaper ($60), and Presonus Studio One (free edition available).
