Editing
=======



### School of thought #1: “Live to tape”

Avoid editing completely when possible.  Provides a “you are there” experience, with all of the good and bad that entails.

### School of thought #2: Balanced approach

Edit out excess verbal tics and hiccups, stuttering, and pauses.  The goal is for the result to sound natural, without anything that would distract.

If you have guests, an additional goal might be to remove anything that might make them sound stupid or unsure.

### School of thought #3: NPR quality

Edit with a bias for perfection, even if it involves making edits that savvier listeners might pick up.
