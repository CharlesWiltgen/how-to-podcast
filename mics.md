Microphones

You're gonna need a microphone or two. The cool kids call them "mics" (pronounced "mikes").

## Long story short

Buy one of these, depending on your needs and budget:

### Under $100

| Mic | Price | Interface | Type | Pickup pattern(s) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| [AT ATR2100-USB](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4) | $60 | USB/XLR | Dynamic | Cardioid |
| [Blue Snowball](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EOPQ7E/?psc=1) | $60–80 | USB | Condenser | Multiple |
| [Blue enCORE 100](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SQJL9U/) | $100 | XLR | Dynamic | Cardioid |

### Over $100

| Mic | Price | Interface | Type | Pickup pattern(s) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| [Heil PR40](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PQYBRNY) | $315 | XLR | Dynamic | Cardioid |
| [Shure SM7B](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002E4Z8M/) | $350 | XLR | Dynamic | Cardioid |
| [MXL 990s](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003XDJAO8/) | $130 | XLR | Condenser| Cardioid |
| [MXL 2001A](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XJDCMC/) | $150 | XLR | Condenser| Cardioid |

**Tip**: Mics occasionally go on sale. You can often snag a good deal using sites like CamelCamelCamel to set up an Amazon price watch for ones you're interested in, and then also checking competitors' site when it happens.

## Kinds of mics

There's many kinds of mics, but for our purposes we're going to divide them into:

* **Dynamic** versus **condenser**
* **USB** versus **XLR**

### Dynamic versus condenser

A mic's [transducer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer) converts sound pressure into an electrical signal.  Although both dynamic and condenser mics have a membrane that vibrates with the air around it, they use different transducer principles.

#### Condenser mics

* Are typically more sensitive than dynamic mics
* Require power (delivered via USB or "[phantom power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_power)" via mic cables)

#### Dynamic mics

* Are less sensitive than dynamic mics, and so can be more forgiving for beginners
* Can sometimes require power (generally called "active dynamic mics")

## Pickup patterns

(TBD)

## Myths

### Condenser mics pick up more "room noise" than dynamic mics

This is the most popular myth in podcasting forums.

Mic sensitivity is linear regardless of the transducer (the thing that converts sound pressure into an electrical signal) technology.

Dynamic mics ARE less sensitive, but if you turn up their preamp gain to match a condenser mic's they'll both "hear" all the same stuff. For more, see:

## Related stuff you might need

#### Mic stands

* [ProLine MS112 Desk Boom Mic Stand](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J0N5TY/)

#### Overhead booms

Boom stands are great because they allow you to sit naturally and bring the mic to you, rather than leaning into the mic.  The user will sound more natural as a result.
