You're gonna need a microphone or two. (The cool kids call them "mics".)

## Long story short

Buy these, depending on your needs and budget:

## Myths

### Condenser mics pick up more "room noise" than dynamic mics

This is the most popular myth in podcasting forums.

Mic sensitivity is linear regardless of the transducer (the thing that converts sound pressure into an electrical signal) technology.

Dynamic mics ARE less sensitive, but if you turn up their preamp gain to match a condenser mic's they'll both "hear" all the same stuff. For more, see:

#### Overhead booms

Boom stands are great because they allow you to sit naturally and bring the mic to you, rather than leaning into the mic.  The user will sound more natural as a result.
