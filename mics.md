You're gonna need a microphone or two. (The cool kids call them "mics".)

#### Mic stands

* [ProLine MS112 Desk Boom Mic Stand](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J0N5TY/)

#### Overhead booms

Boom stands are great because they allow you to sit naturally and bring the mic to you, rather than leaning into the mic.  The user will sound more natural as a result.
