# FeedBurner


Whatever you do I'd recommend you at least set up and then route your RSS feed through Feedburner. Now some people are going to call foul on thatâ€¦
Your advice is very good at heart, but the specific recommendation for FeedBurner is not. Here are the practical reasons why:

FeedBurner stats were created for blogs and their web pages, not podcasts and their MP3 enclosures. As a result, the stats are inaccurate and will report that you have more listeners than you actually do.

"Do Not Resuscitate" is tattooed on FB's chest. It's going to die someday, without warning, taking years of your hard-won subscribers with it. This happened in Japan in late July, 2012.
Happily, the solutions are straightforward:

Blubrry provides basic podcast stats for free.

Gotcha. If you ever want to eliminate the FeedBurner dependency (and the change you'll lose your subscribers when it goes down), you can redirect a designated public podcast feed URL anywhere you like using your web server, or with a WordPress plug-in like [Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/).

For example, you might use the URL "http://mydomain.com/podcast/feed/" as your official/canonical feed URL, but redirect that to the feed URL of your current host when it's requested.

(Technical detail: Use an HTTP 302 redirect, instead of a 301 redirect. That way, podcast apps will continue to treat the original URL as canonical.)

Also, legit podcast hosts always provide a way to cleanly move off of their system.
