# Metrics

### What are “Metrics”?

Metrics are a measure of how your podcast is doing.

For podcasting, we measure “downloads”.

Specifically, the standard metric is **unique downloads of an episode within 30 days of availability**.

If you know that number from episode to episode, you have a good idea of your reach and what the trend looks like. It's not as precise as what proprietary platforms can provide, but it's dramatically better than what radio distribution (for example) provides.
