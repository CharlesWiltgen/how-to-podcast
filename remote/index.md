# Overview

There are two options for including remote participants—VoIP calls, and “multi-enders”.

## VoIP

“Voice over IP” solutions do voice and/or video calls over the internet.

Skype the most popular example of this, and (not surprisingly) the most popular VoIP option for podcasters. It supports high-quality Skype-to-Skype calls via desktop, mobile, and web apps, and phone-quality calls with anybody else with a phone number.

Other popular options include:

* **[Skype](http://skype.com/)**
* **[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)**
* **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**
* **[Discord](https://discordapp.com/)**
* **[Zoom.us](https://zoom.us/)**

## Multi-enders

Some VoIP solutions also help automate “multi-enders” — a workflow where high-quality call recording is done on each participant’s side as well and then merged after.
