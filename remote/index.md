# Overview

There are two options for including remote participants while recording a podcast: **VoIP calls**, and **multi-enders**.

## VoIP

“Voice over IP” solutions do voice and/or video calls over the internet.

Skype the most popular example of this, and (not surprisingly) the most popular VoIP option for podcasters. It supports high-quality Skype-to-Skype calls via desktop, mobile, and web apps, and phone-quality calls with anybody else with a phone number.

Other popular options include:

* **[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)** 🔥
* **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**
* **[Discord](https://discordapp.com/)**
* **[Zoom.us](https://zoom.us/)**

## Multi-enders

Some VoIP solutions also help automate “multi-enders” — a workflow where high-quality call recording is done on each participant’s side as well and then merged after.
