# Overview

There are two options for including remote participants:

## VoIP

Skype is by far the most popular VoIP solution for podcasters. You can use it not only with Skype users, and with anybody else with a phone number.

* Slack
* Discord
* Zoom

## Multi-enders

Some VoIP solutions also help automate “multi-enders” — a workflow where high-quality call recording is done on each participant’s side as well and then merged after.

* Ringr
