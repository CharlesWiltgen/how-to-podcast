# Music

Here are the most popular free and inexpensive sources for royalty-free music, DIY loops and sound effects.

#### “Royalty free”?

Royalty-free audio is created expressly so you can use it legally, without having to pay ongoing royalties or license fees. You _must_ use only “[royalty-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music)” music in your podcast, or music that you otherwise have permission or an explicit license to use.

Note that “royalty-free” (i.e. free to use) doesn’t neccessarily mean “free” (i.e. free to license), although some music is both.

Please pay attention to the Terms and Conditions on anything you download, and make sure you provide proper attribution when needed. (Show notes are good for this.)
