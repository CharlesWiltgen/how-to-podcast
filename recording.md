## Audio interfaces

An [**audio interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card#Professional_soundcards_.28audio_interfaces.29) does two things:

1. It converts analog signals created by a mics/headsets into digital streams suitable for recording.

1. It converts digital streams sent by computers or mobile devices into analog signals suitable for headphones/headsets and speakers.

If you have a USB mic or headset, the audio interface is built in.

If you have XLR mics, you'll need to buy an audio interface.

## Single-enders vs. multi-enders

## Example scenarios

### One person + USB mic

Traditionally, podcast recording setups included a [mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console), whose job is to mix several audio inputs — for example, multiple mics — into a stereo output suitable for recording.

Lately, "mixer-free" setups are becoming more popular.
