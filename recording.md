## Audio interfaces

An **[audio interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card#Professional_soundcards_.28audio_interfaces.29)** does two things:

1. It converts analog signals created by a mics\/headsets into digital streams suitable for recording.

2. It converts digital streams sent by computers or mobile devices into analog signals suitable for headphones\/headsets and speakers.


If you have a USB mic or headset, the audio interface is built in.

If you have XLR mics, you'll need to buy an audio interface.

## Mixers

I'm Team Audio Interface \(or recorder, although you can't do a mix-minus Skype setups with a Zoom H6\). But in an attempt to be fair and balanced:

**Mixer**

* ☑︎ Physical knobs and sliders are cool and fun
* ☑︎ If compressor/limiter, useful for live/live-to-tape scenarios
* ☒ Built-in USB output typically only 2 channels
* ☒ Built-in A2D hardware typically offers mid-range quality

**Audio interface**

* ☑︎ Captures one track per input \(easier to process, edit\)
* ☑︎ Typically better A2D hardware
* ☑︎ Typically supports better sample rates\/resolutions
* ☑︎ Allows for a far more compact setup, easier to store\/transport
* ☒ Clumsier for live/live-to-tape scenarios

## Single-enders vs. multi-enders

## Example scenarios

### One person + USB mic

Traditionally, podcast recording setups included a [mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console), whose job is to mix several audio inputs — for example, multiple mics — into a stereo output suitable for recording.

Lately, "mixer-free" setups are becoming more popular.

## Tips & Tricks

* **DO** record and save and edit on your primary drive \(vs. an external or network drive\). You can always copy or move files after.
