Grow Your Audience
=======

The constant challenge of podcasters is finding and growing their audience.

## 50 ways to help connect With and grow your audience

1. Know who your audience is, ideally before you even start.  The way to do this is by creating a [**persona**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona#In_marketing), which is an imaginary ideal listener. 

1. Apply for inclusion in [**Google News**](https://partnerdash.google.com/partnerdash/d/news#p:id=pfehome).

1. Offer to speak at a [**Meetup**](meetup.com). If you travel, offer to speak at Meetup groups in cities that you visit. Create your own Meetup related to the topic of your podcast. 

1. Join [**LinkedIn**](linkedin.com) groups related to your podcast. Check in regularly and contribute to conversations.

1. Put out episodes regularly. One per week (or more) is ideal, but one every two weeks is fine.

1. Make your podcast title more discoverable with keywords. Bad: "Close Call". Good: "Close Call - Funny Phone Calls with Our Neighbors"

1. Make episode titles descriptive instead of "cute". They're an opportunity to use keywords that you want to be assocated with your podcast.
