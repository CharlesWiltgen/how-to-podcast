## Record with software

### Skype plug-ins \(Mac\)

* **[Ecamm Call Recorder for Skype](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)** \(Mac, $30\) — This Skype plug-in can record your own microphone input and the output of your Skype call as separate tracks in a single QuickTime movie. An included utility allows you to split that file into separate files for each track, and convert them to other formats.

* **[Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower)** \(Mac, free!\) — This open source software allows apps to send audio to other apps. \(A pre-built installer is available at the top of the description.\) For example, you can use Soundflower to send Skype output to apps like QuickTime Player, Audacity, etc. for recording.


### Skype plug-ins \(Windows\)

* **[Amolto](http://www.evaer.com/)** \($30, free for audio-only\) — A Skype call recorder that supports audio and video.

* **[CallGraph](https://scribie.com/free-skype-recorder)** \(free!\) — An easy-to-use, audio-only Skype call recorder.

* **[Evaer](http://www.evaer.com/)** \($20, trial available\) — A Skype call recorder that supports audio and video.

* **[MP3 Skype Recorder](http://voipcallrecording.com/)** \(free!\) — Only records to compressed MP3 files, which will result in lower quality recordings compared to alternatives which can record to uncompressed WAV or AIFF files. Try to avoid, but if you must use be sure to set "Recording BitRate" to 128.

* **[Pamela Call Recorder](http://www.pamela.biz/)** \(15€\) — Paid version supports unlimited recording, can record up to 15 minutes for free.

### iOS

\(TBD\)

## Skype pre-call checklist

1. Use a **wired connection** to the internet if at all possible, and ask other participants to do the same. Connect your PC or laptop to your router or cable modem with an Ethernet cable to \(1\) prevent wireless interference and other issues from ruining your interview, and \(2\) improves the odds of Skype being able to use its highest-quality mode.

2. If you're using Skype call recording software to record the call, confirm that it's set **record to an uncompressed WAV or AIFF file** \(and not MP3 files\). The only time you should create an MP3 file is before you upload your final episode to your podcast host.

3. Ask participants to **pause any background file transfers** during the call, because it can interrupt calls or make them sound like drunk robots. Things that might do this include sync solutions like Dropbox, backup solutions like Carbonite, and BitTorrent clients like µTorrent.

4. Change your Skype status to **"Do Not Disturb"** during the call, and suggest that your guest do the same. This will keep another call from coming in, which can throw off the conversation and create unwanted noises in your recording.


## Processing Skype recordings

Use a [high-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter) to remove anything under 300Hz \(which is junk\), and a [low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter) to remove all of the distortion and hiss above 3400Hz.

You can also use EQ in the 1kHz–3kHz range to make male voices "pop", and to make female voices a bit "warmer".

## Tips and tricks

* **DO** strongly suggest that remote participants use a mic or headset. A perfectly good headset is amazingly inexpensive — the **[Plantronics .Audio 326](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S2RCXW)** is only 9 bucks as I write this.

* **DO NOT** record video unless you must. It almost inevitably impacts audio quality because Skype is working with a finite \(and usually small\) amount of upstream bandwidth.
