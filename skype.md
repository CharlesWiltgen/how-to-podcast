# Using Skype

**[Skype](http://skype.com/)** is the most popular way to conduct remote interviews, and include remote co-hosts and guests in your podcast.

## Skype pre-call checklist

1. Use a **wired connection** to the internet if at all possible, and ask other participants to do the same. Connect your PC or laptop to your router or cable modem with an Ethernet cable to \(1\) prevent wireless interference and other issues from ruining your interview, and \(2\) improves the odds of Skype being able to use its highest-quality mode.

2. If you're using Skype call recording software to record the call, confirm that it's set **record to an uncompressed WAV or AIFF file** \(and not MP3 files\). The only time you should create an MP3 file is before you upload your final episode to your podcast host.

3. Ask participants to **pause any background file transfers** during the call, because it can interrupt calls or make them sound like drunk robots. Things that might do this include sync solutions like Dropbox, backup solutions like Carbonite, and BitTorrent clients like µTorrent.



4. Change your Skype status to **"Do Not Disturb"** during the call, and suggest that your guest do the same. This will keep another call from coming in, which can throw off the conversation and create unwanted noises in your recording.





## Processing Skype recordings



Use a [high-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter) to remove anything under 300Hz \(which is junk\), and a [low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter) to remove all of the distortion and hiss above 3400Hz.



You can also use EQ in the 1kHz–3kHz range to make male voices "pop", and to make female voices a bit "warmer".



## Tips and tricks



* **DO** strongly suggest that remote participants use a mic or headset. A perfectly good headset is amazingly inexpensive — the **[Plantronics .Audio 326](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S2RCXW)** is only 9 bucks as I write this.



* **DO NOT** record video unless you must. It almost inevitably impacts audio quality because Skype is working with a finite \(and usually small\) amount of upstream bandwidth.



* **DO** use routers that support “QoS”, which can ensure that Skype and other VoIP traffic is always given preference.
