Using Skype
=======

[**Skype**](http://skype.com/) is the most popular way to conduct remote interviews, and include remote co-hosts and guests in your podcast.

## Recording

### Single-enders vs. multi-enders

*(TBD)*

### Software (Mac)

* [**Ecamm Call Recorder for Skype**](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/) (Mac, $30) — This Skype plug-in can record your own microphone input and the output of your Skype call as separate tracks in a single QuickTime movie. An included utility allows you to split that file into separate files for each track, and convert them to other formats.

### Software (Windows)

* [**CallGraph Skype Recorder**](https://scribie.com/free-skype-recorder) (free) — An easy-to-use, audio-only Skype call recorder.

* [**Virtual Audio Cable**, **Voicemeeter**, **Voicemeeter Banana**](http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) (donation requested) — This "virtual mixer" software allows you to route audio between applications, meaning that you can send Skype output to a "virtual input" to record with Audacity or your [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) of choice.

## Processing Skype recordings

Use a [high-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter) to remove anything under 300Hz (which is junk), and a [low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter) to remove all of the distortion and hiss above 3400Hz.

You can also use EQ in the 1kHz–3kHz range to make male voices "pop", and to make female voices a bit "warmer". 

## Tips and tricks

* **DO** use a wired connection. Connect your PC or laptop to your router or cable modem with a good ol' Ethernet cable to prevent wireless interference and other issues from ruining your interview.

* **DO** insist that remote participants use a mic or headset. A perfectly good headset os amazingly inexpensive — the [**Plantronics .Audio 326**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S2RCXW) is only 9 bucks as I write this.

* **DO** ask participants to pause any large downloads and (especially) uploads during the call, because it can make them sound like drunk robots. Things that might do this include Dropbox and BitTorrent.

* **DO** record to uncompressed WAV or AIFF files, **NOT** MP3 files. The only time you should create an MP3 file is before you upload your final episode to your podcast host.
