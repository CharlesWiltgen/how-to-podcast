# Using music in your podcast

You can use music in your podcast if:

* In the public domain, or
* It has a CreativeCommons (CC) license that’s compatible with your use, or
* That you otherwise have an explicit license(s) or permission to use

Because of the way podcasts and music rights work — podcasts requires the same licenses one would need to reproduce and distribute a CD — in practical terms this means you're limited to:

* Public domain music
* CC-licensed music (with a license compatible with your use)
* Royalty-free music

# Copyright and Fair Use

Confusion around "fair use" is a constant. Here are resources to help you understand if your use of copyrighted materials may fall under U.S. copyright law "fair use" exemptions.

## Copyright

## Fair Use

Fair use isn’t a right, but a legal defense.
