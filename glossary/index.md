<a name="cpm">**CPM**</a> • Advertising term meaning "cost per thousand impressions". In the case of podcasting, "impression" means "unique download". If your ad rate is $25 CPM, and you have 10,000 downloads, you’ll get $250. (Trivia: Why “CPM” instead of “CPT”? “M” = Roman numeral “mille” = 1,000.)

<a name="download">**download**</a> • 

<a name="episode">**episode**</a> • The atomic unit of podcasting. A “<a href="#podcast">podcast</a>” is a collection of one or more “episodes”. In the podcast feed, an episode is represented as an `<item>` with an `<enclosure>`.

<a name="live-streaming">**live streaming**</a> • A way to distribute content that has nothing to do with podcasting. You can record a livestream of a _show_ and distribute _that_ as a podcast, but anyone who uses the phrase “live podcast” should be pummeled about the head and neck with a cucumber until they use words correctly.

<a name="lufs">**LUFS**</a> • An acronym for “Loudness Units Relative to Full Scale”, all you really need to know is that it’s a standard way to measure how loud something is. For podcasts, the defacto standard is -16 LUFS for stereo or -19 LUFS for mono — both are perceptually equivalent. This matches loudness standards for services like iTunes and Spotify, helping ensure that listeners aren’t subject to wild volume swings as they enjoy different audio content.

<a name="podcast">**podcast**</a> • A show distributed in an open, standards-based way that we call “podcasting”. Critically, “podcast” doesn’t refer to a particular kind of content but how it’s delivered. A good litmus test for “Is this a podcast?” is whether it can be played in Apple Podcasts and other true podcast apps — if it can, it’s a podcast.

<a name="podcast-network">**podcast network**</a> • A podcast network is a collection of podcasts that are produced and/or distributed through a single company, or network. A typical benefit of a podcast network is that the member podcasts can be made available to advertisers as a group, instead of individually.
