**CPM** • Advertising term meaning "cost per thousand impressions". In the case of podcasting, "impression" means "unique download". If your ad rate is $25 CPM, and you have 10,000 downloads, you’ll get $250.

**LUFS** • An acronym for “Loudness Units Relative to Full Scale”, all you really need to know is that it’s a standard way to measure how loud something is. For podcasts, the defacto standard is -16 LUFS for stereo or -19 LUFS for mono — both are perceptually equivalent. This matches loudness standards for services like iTunes and Spotify, helping ensure that listeners aren’t subject to wild volume swings as they enjoy different audio content.

**podcast network** • A podcast network is a collection of podcasts that are produced and/or distributed through a single company, or network. A typical benefit of a podcast network is that the member podcasts can be made available to advertisers as a group, instead of individually.
