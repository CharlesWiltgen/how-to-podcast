# Checklist: Editing

## Template

* As you edit, **build a template** containing your bumpers and various tracks set up the way you like them
* The template will commonly have tracks for the host\(s\), local guest\(s\), Skype/VoIP guests, music, and incidental audio \(you won’t use all of them every time\), all set up as you like

## Prep

- [ ] **Backup source**: Archive source recording to .zip file
- [ ] **Mono-ize**: If mic sources were recorded as stereo files, convert them to mono
- [ ] **De-clip** \(optional\) if source appears to be clipped
  - [ ] Normalize to -3 dBFS, de-clip with -3.2 dBFS threshold
- [ ] **Normalize VoIP tracks** to -6 dBFS
