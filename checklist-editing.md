# Checklist: Editing

## Template

* As you edit, build a template containing your bumpers and various tracks set up the way you like them
* The template will commonly have tracks for the host(s), local guest(s), Skype/VoIP guests, music, incidental audio (you wonâ€™t use all of them every time)

## Prep

* **Backup source**: Archive source recording to .zip file
* **Mono-ize**: If mic sources were recorded as stereo files, convert them to mono
* **De-clip** (optional) if source appears to be clipped
    * Normalize to -3 dBFS, de-clip with -3.2 dBFS threshold
* **Normalize VoIP tracks** to -6 dBFS
