# Checklist: Editing

## Prep

* **Backup source**: Archive source recording to .zip file
* **Mono-ize**: If mic sources were recorded as stereo files, convert them to mono
* **De-clip** (optional) if source appears to be clipped
    * Normalize to -3 dBFS, de-clip with -3.2 dBFS threshold
* **Normalize VoIP tracks** to -6 dBFS
